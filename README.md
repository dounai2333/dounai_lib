## CSO2 dounai_lib

This is a Lua library made for a video game [Counter-Strike: Online 2](https://cso2.wohlnet.ru/).

## About

There was tons of new additional APIs, with more features and bug fixes, they will save your time a lot!

**This project is tested and working in Qingxue and Global server, support with other servers is unknown.**
